# LLAMAS_validation
This is a repository storing the raw data and analysis for the validation of the EEG-LLAMAS (https://github.com/jalevitt/EEG-LLAMAS) EEG-fMRI artifact removal project.

the project and data files are too large to host on Github, so they are available for download on Dropbox instead: (to be filled in)

This page is just a pointer to the dropbox host for now, unless I find a better solution.

For inquiries please email jalevitt@bu.edu
