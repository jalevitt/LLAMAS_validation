# LLAMAS_validation
This is a repository storing the raw data and analysis for the validation of the EEG-LLAMAS (https://github.com/jalevitt/EEG-LLAMAS) EEG-fMRI artifact removal project.

the project and data files are too large to host on Github, so for now sample data is avaliable for download on Dropbox instead: https://www.dropbox.com/sh/qan0nxss7ilvt0w/AAB4O3lt2yupUOU2tIkkJy9Sa?dl=0

This page is just a pointer to the dropbox host for now, unless I find a better solution.

For inquiries please email jalevitt@bu.edu
